      Vola is Ubac's most emblematic eco-responsible and recycled sneaker. It is
      the first ethical model that the brand has launched. Made of recycled
      wool, Green EVA for the sole and recycled polyester laces, this
      sustainable product ensures great comfort and resistance. Made from
      recycled wool and spun Made In France, the Vola sneaker is manufactured in
      Portugal in excellent workshops. Without leather, Ubac is committed to
      produce in the respect of workers to ensure ethical shoes, vegan or not
      depending on the model. Available for men and women, in a wide range of
      sizes (from 35 to 46) and colors, these shoes are studied and designed to
      be the most environmentally friendly by using a maximum of recycled
      materials. Looking for eco-responsible sneakers with recycled materials
      you know the origin? Vola is made for you!
