To generate SSL certificates for your local domain `jamsrworld.dev` using `mkcert`, follow these steps:

### 1. Install `mkcert`
If you haven't installed `mkcert` yet, you can do so using the following commands based on your operating system:

- **macOS (using Homebrew):**
  ```bash
  brew install mkcert
  brew install nss # For Firefox support
  ```

- **Linux:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libnss3-tools
  sudo apt install mkcert
  mkcert -install
  ```

- **Windows:**
  Download the `mkcert` executable from the [mkcert releases page](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases), place it in a directory in your PATH, and then run:
  ```bash
  mkcert -install
  ```

### 2. Create a Local Certificate Authority (CA)
Run the following command to create and install a local CA in your system's trust store:
```bash
mkcert -install
```

### 3. Generate Certificates for `jamsrworld.dev`
Now, generate the SSL certificate for your domain:
```bash
mkcert jamsrworld.dev "*.jamsrworld.dev"
```
This will generate two files:
- `jamsrworld.dev+1.pem` (the certificate)
- `jamsrworld.dev+1-key.pem` (the private key)

### 4. Use the Certificates in Nginx or Your Web Server
Here’s an example of how you might configure Nginx to use these certificates:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name jamsrworld.dev *.jamsrworld.dev;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/jamsrworld.dev+1.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/jamsrworld.dev+1-key.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; # or whatever service you’re running
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name jamsrworld.dev *.jamsrworld.dev;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

Replace `/path/to/` with the actual path where your certificates are stored.

### 5. Access Your Local Domain
With this setup, you should be able to access `https://jamsrworld.dev` and its subdomains locally with SSL.
